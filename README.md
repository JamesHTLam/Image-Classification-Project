# Image-Classification-WebApp
## This is a web application that use different trained Convolutional Neural Network models to perform image classification.
3 sets of data sets are used:
- CIFAR-10: for 10 different categories of objects, which are airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
- MNIST: for handwritten digits from 0 - 9
- UTKFace: for facial image in terms of a) Age: from 0 - 116, b) Gender: Male or Female, and c) Ethnicity: White, Black, Asian, Indian, and Others (like Hispanic, Latino, Middle Eastern).
